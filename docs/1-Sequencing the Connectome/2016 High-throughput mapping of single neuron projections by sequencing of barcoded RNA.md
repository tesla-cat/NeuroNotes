- MAPseq: Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing

### Introduction

- In MAPseq, we uniquely label neurons in a source region by injecting a viral library encoding a diverse collection of barcode sequences. 
    - The barcode mRNA is expressed at high levels and transported into the axon terminals at distal target projection regions. 
    - To read out **single neuron projection patterns**, we then extract and sequence barcode mRNA from the **injection site**, as well as from each **target region** of interest. Spatial resolution of MAPseq is limited mainly by the precision of target dissection. 

- Although MAPseq, like GFP tracing, does not distinguish fibers of passage, we minimize their contribution by avoiding large fiber bundles during the dissection of target areas. 
- Using this procedure, the brain-wide map of projections from a given area can be determined in less than a week. By reformulating projection mapping as a problem of sequencing, MAPseq harnesses advances in high-throughput sequencing to permit efficient single neuron circuit tracing.
