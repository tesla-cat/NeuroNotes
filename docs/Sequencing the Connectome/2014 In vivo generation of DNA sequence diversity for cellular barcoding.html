genetic barcode rely on the creation of diverse libraries <strong>in vitro</strong> and subsequent delivery of genetic material into a host cell at low-copy number. Such in vitro approaches are limited by cloning bottlenecks that cause reduced library diversities and sequence biases, by incomplete labelling of all cells within a population, by the possibility of introducing multiple barcodes per cell, and by the challenges of working across organisms (e.g. retroviral barcoding cannot be applied in some organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans).</p></li><li><p><strong>In vivo</strong> barcoding has the potential to overcome all of these limitations. Mechanisms for generating diversity in vivo exist, endogenously, in many organisms—most notably the mammalian immune system. However, efforts to repurpose the immune system&#x27;s V(D)J recombination for in vivo cellular barcoding yielded limited barcode diversity—on the order of a dozen unique sequences—in cells other than lymphocytes. <code>Exogenous recombinases</code> have been successfully applied to generate diverse combinations of colours for cellular tagging purposes. This technique, better known as <code>Brainbow</code>, relies on <code>Cre recombinase</code> to rearrange a cassette resulting in the stochastic expression of a subset of different coloured fluorescent proteins (XFPs) in neurons. The theoretical diversity of Brainbow is in the hundreds, but cannot be easily assayed with DNA sequencing because it relies heavily on gene copy number variation as well as recombination. We reasoned that by replacing XFPs with unique sequences, we could design a barcoding system with the potential to achieve diversities that matched the scale of high-throughput sequencing technologies.</p></li><li><p>We have developed a novel method of generating sequence diversity in vivo for the purpose of cellular barcoding. Our method, which relies on a DNA invertase (转化酶)—<code>Rci</code>, recombinase for clustered inversion—to shuffle fragments of DNA, has the potential to easily achieve diversities over 1e9 unique sequences. Here, we show that this method can be applied for the in vivo generation of diversity in E. coli.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="materials-and-methods">MATERIALS AND METHODS<a class="hash-link" href="#materials-and-methods" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><div class="ctr"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zOStRhccn6M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div><div class="ctr"><img src="/img/p7.png" width="600"></div><details class="details_Q743 alert alert--info details_h+cY" data-collapsed="true"><summary><p>In silico simulations</p><ul><li>We defined <code>Cre</code> recombination as two independent binding events to <code>loxP</code> sites.</li><li>We defined <code>Rci</code> recombination as two independent binding events to <code>sfx</code> sites.</li><li><code>Cre</code> (bad): excision + inversion =&gt; less diversity</li><li><code>Rci</code> (good): inversion only =&gt; more diversity</li></ul></summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_K5uX"><ul><li>We performed in silico simulations to determine the behaviour of different cassette architectures. <ul><li>For <code>Cre</code>-based cassettes, ncell cassettes (ncell = 10 000) of nfrag fragments (nfrag = 100) were operated on independently.

Sequencing reads are processed independently. Each known barcode fragment is aligned to the sequence read (in both orientations) with a thresholded <code>Smith–Waterman alignment</code> and the position of the segment along the read is stored. The threshold is set by a bootstrap method. Briefly, one hundred randomly generated 100-mers are aligned to all of the sequence traces and a score is associated with each alignment. The mean score plus two standard deviations is considered the threshold for all subsequent alignments. The complete barcode can be reconstructed based on the positions of each segment. Because the algorithm relies only on local alignment, this method is extremely robust to sequencing errors.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="results">RESULTS<a class="hash-link" href="#results" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="design-of-cre-based-barcoding">Design of Cre-based barcoding<a class="hash-link" href="#design-of-cre-based-barcoding" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Our design goals were to create a modular genetically encoded barcode system that is easily scalable, cross-platform (applicable across model organisms), compatible with high-throughput sequencing technologies and robust to sequencing errors. Our ultimate goal is to generate unique barcodes to label all of the cells of the mouse cortex—approximately 1e7 neurons. In general, if the repertoire of possible barcodes is substantially greater than the number of cells in the population of interest, then even randomly generated barcodes will label most cells uniquely. Specifically, if n is the number of cells and k is the number of possible barcodes, then under simple assumptions the fraction of uniquely labelled cells will be exp(-n/k). Thus assuming one barcode per cell, a barcode repertoire exceeding the number of cells by a factor of 100 will yield 99% uniquely labelled cells. Therefore, we sought a barcode system with the potential to scale to at least 100 × 1e7 = 1e9 unique barcodes.</p><p>Our initial design relied on Cre recombinase to shuffle and pare down a cassette of n barcode fragments (each fragment flanked by lox sites in alternating orientation) by stochastic inversion and excision events to leave a single fragment. Cre acts by binding to and mediating recombination between two of its cognate DNA sequences, called lox sites. Cre-mediated recombination between any two compatible lox sites in the same orientation causes the excision of the intervening sequence elements. In contrast, recombination between lox sites in opposing orientation causes the inversion of any intervening sequence elements.</p><p>This architecture has a theoretical diversity of 2n after completion, since any fragment, j, of the n fragments can end in either the forward or inverted orientation. Several variant lox sites have been discovered with a wide variety of characteristics. The Brainbow system, e.g. employed three lox sites that were shown to be mutually incompatible including loxP (the original lox site), loxN and lox2272. We reasoned that a Cre-based barcoding approach could be extended to achieve higher diversities by concatenating k cassettes of n fragments, where each cassette employs one of a subset of incompatible lox sites. Here, the theoretical diversity is (2n)^k because each cassette operates independently. Thus with n = 100, k = 4, theoretical diversities reach our goal of 1e9 unique sequences.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the reported lox variants have not been validated for complete incompatibility or pairwise efficiency. Moreover, because of the repetitive nature of lox sites it would be difficult to synthesize cassettes with the hundreds of fragments required to achieve our target diversity. For example, an architecture with n = 100, k = 4, where each fragment is above the minimum length (~100 bp) for efficient recombination, requires a large genomic insertion with a length &gt;60 kb. Finally, simulations suggested that Cre-based architectures are subject to considerable biases that limit the diversities that can be achieved in practice.</p><header><h1>TODO</h1></header></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/Sequencing the Connectome/2014 In vivo generation of DNA sequence diversity for cellular barcoding.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_mS5F" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/NeuroNotes/docs/Sequencing the Connectome/NeuroNotes/docs/Sequencing the Connectome/2012 Sequencing the Connectome"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">2012 Sequencing the Connectome</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/NeuroNotes/docs/Sequencing the Connectome/NeuroNotes/docs/Sequencing the Connectome/2016 High-throughput mapping of single neuron projections by sequencing of barcoded RNA"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">2016 High-throughput mapping of single neuron projections by sequencing of barcoded RNA</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_vrFS thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#introduction" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">INTRODUCTION</a></li><li><a href="#materials-and-methods" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">MATERIALS AND METHODS</a></li><li><a href="#results" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">RESULTS</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 NeuroNotes, Inc.
