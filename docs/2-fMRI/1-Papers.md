### In-vivo delineation of human brain networks and areas

- We have utilized resting-fMRI to generate canonical parcellations of the cerebral cortex 大脑皮层, cerebellum 小脑 and striatum 纹状体 into distributed large-scale **networks**. 
    - Our parcellations are widely used as references to study human brain organization and disorders. 
- We have extended our **network-level** parcellations to **areal-level** parcellations, which comprises **hundreds** of regions approximating classical cortical 皮质 areas with distinct function, connectivity, architectonics and topography. 
- Moving beyond **population-level** parcellations, we have developed algorithms to delineate individual-specific cerebral cortical and subcortical 皮层下 networks.

### Functional architecture of the human brain

- using resting-fMRI (from 1000 participants) and task-activation (from 10,449 experiments), **we showed that sensory-motor regions were functionally specialized, i.e., they participated in one resting-state network or cognitive process**. 
    - By contrast, the `association cortex` was characterized by complex zones ranging from highly **specialized** to highly **flexible**. 
    - Functionally flexible regions participated in multiple cognitive processes to different degrees. This heterogeneous selectivity was predicted by the connectivity between flexible and specialized regions. 
    - Functionally flexible regions might support binding or integrating specialized brain networks that, in turn, contribute to the ability to execute multiple and varied tasks. 
- As another example, **we recently demonstrated that dynamic functional connectivity explains task performance (but not self-reported measures) better than static functional connectivity**. 
    - This suggests that resting brain dynamics at different timescales capture distinct aspects of human behavior. 
- Finally, **we demonstrated considerable heritability 遗传力 in both the size and spatial organization of individual-specific network topography across cortex.**

### Multi-scale neuroscience 

- The human brain is a complex system spanning from micrometer (cellular) to centimeter (fMRI) scales. We have contributed to **bridging the gap between microscale and macroscale** brain organizations. 
    - For example, **we found that genes enriched in the supragranular layers of the human cerebral cortex (relative to mouse) were expressed in a topography reflecting broad cortical classes (sensory/motor, paralimbic, associational) and associated network properties.**
        - Therefore, molecular innovations of upper cortical layers may be important for the evolution of long-range corticocortical projections. 
    - In addition to genetics, we have been exploiting **machine learning algorithms to invert large-scale biophysical models**. The estimated biophysical model parameters in turn provide insights into the large-scale and cellular organization of the human brain. 
        - For example, **we recently demonstrated that a biophysically plausible mean field model best explained resting-state functional connectivity when local microscale properties mirrored the hierarchical axis of the human brain.**

### Individual differences in behavior and disorder

</summary>

- Machine learning is critical for precision medicine. For example, current mental disorder categories are based on symptom checklists and not carving nature by its joints. Subtypes within disorders and overlaps across disorders suggest the existence of shared neurobiological factors across disorders. 
    - We have utilized **unsupervised machine learning** to discover latent factors in late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia. The factors were associated with distinct atrophy patterns, as well as distinct memory and executive function decline trajectories among dementia patients and at-risk nondemented participants. There is significant ongoing work in the lab on **discovering factors (or subtypes)** underlying heterogeneity in neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, etc. 
    - While unsupervised machine learning is useful for discovering new insights into mental disorders, **supervised machine learning** is useful when we know what we want to predict, e.g., behavioral traits 特征, disease progression and treatment responses. 
        - For example, **we have utilized deep recurrent neural networks to predict AD progression up to five years into the future**. As of March 27th 2021, our algorithm is ranked third out of more than fifty entries in the TADPOLE challenge.

### Image processing and statistics 

</summary>

- We have contributed towards resolving brain imaging processing and statistical issues. 
    - For example, an in-depth analysis of statistical issues involved in studying fMRI dynamics revealed several surprising results, e.g., first order autoregressive models explain fMRI dynamics better than nonlinear biophysical models. 
    - As another example, global signal regression (GSR) is one of the most controversial preprocessing steps for resting-state functional MRI. 
        - The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of GSR in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. 
        - Instead we considered the utilitarian question of whether GSR strengthens or weakens brain-behavior relationships. Across two healthy young adult datasets (N > 2000), we showed that GSR strengthened the associations between resting-state functional connectivity and most cognitive, personality and emotion measures. 
    - While the previous examples are specific to neuroimaging, we have also developed general methods applicable beyond neuroimaging. 
        - For example, the cerebral cortex is often represented as a 2D sphere, motivating our interest in spherical image processing and registration. We extended a sampling theorem in Euclidean space to the 2-Sphere and utilized the theorem to construct overcomplete wavelets for spherical image processing. 
        - We have also exploited differential geometric techniques and Lie group of diffeomorphisms to develop fast algorithms for image registration.
