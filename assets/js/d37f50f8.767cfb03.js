In general, if the repertoire of possible barcodes is substantially greater than the number of cells in the population of interest, then even randomly generated barcodes will label most cells uniquely. Specifically, if n is the number of cells and k is the number of possible barcodes, then under simple assumptions the fraction of uniquely labelled cells will be exp(-n/k). Thus assuming one barcode per cell, a barcode repertoire exceeding the number of cells by a factor of 100 will yield 99% uniquely labelled cells. Therefore, we sought a barcode system with the potential to scale to at least 100 \xd7 1e7 = 1e9 unique barcodes."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Our initial design relied on Cre recombinase to shuffle and pare down a cassette of n barcode fragments (each fragment flanked by lox sites in alternating orientation) by stochastic inversion and excision events to leave a single fragment.

Cre-mediated recombination between any two compatible lox sites in the same orientation causes the excision of the intervening sequence elements. In contrast, recombination between lox sites in opposing orientation causes the inversion of any intervening sequence elements."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"This architecture has a theoretical diversity of 2n after completion, since any fragment, j, of the n fragments can end in either the forward or inverted orientation. Several variant lox sites have been discovered with a wide variety of characteristics. The Brainbow system, e.g. employed three lox sites that were shown to be mutually incompatible including loxP (the original lox site), loxN and lox2272. We reasoned that a Cre-based barcoding approach could be extended to achieve higher diversities by concatenating k cassettes of n fragments, where each cassette employs one of a subset of incompatible lox sites. Here, the theoretical diversity is (2n)^k because each cassette operates independently. Thus with n = 100, k = 4, theoretical diversities reach our goal of 1e9 unique sequences."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Unfortunately, many of the reported lox variants have not been validated for complete incompatibility or pairwise efficiency. Moreover, because of the repetitive nature of lox sites it would be difficult to synthesize cassettes with the hundreds of fragments required to achieve our target diversity.
